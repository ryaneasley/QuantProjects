## The two scripts can be found in the master branch ##

Hi there,
In this folder are two codes in Python, one which constructs the optimal portfolio utilizing genetic optimization and the other script backtests the portfolio or any portfolio you can construct.
The following code serves to construct an optimal portfolio by means of genetic optimization.
The inputs are: tickers, weights, and portfolio size.
The outputs are: two portfolios with tickers and weights that are optimized for max Sharpe Ratio and max expected return. 
Hope this helps!
